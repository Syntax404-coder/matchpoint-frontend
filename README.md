# MatchPoint Frontend

This is how I run the MatchPoint frontend locally on my machine.

## Prerequisites

I ensure that **Node.js** is installed on my system.

## Setup

First, I install the project dependencies by running:

```sh
npm install
```

## Running Locally

To start the development server and work on the project, I run:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Once the server starts, I can access the application at `http://localhost:5173` (or the port specified in the terminal output).

## Building for Production

When I'm ready to deploy or test the production build, I compile the assets using:

```sh
npm run build
```

The built files will be located in the `dist/` directory.

## Linting

To check my code for stylistic issues and potential errors, I use:

```sh
npm run lint
```
